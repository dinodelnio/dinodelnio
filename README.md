# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dino Delnio, and this is myself-introduction. I'm excited to share a little bit about myself and my interests in the world of techonology.

## About me
I'm a student with a keen interest in technology, such as AI, robotics, and design.

## Skills
Here are some of my key skills and interests:

- Python: I have a basic understanding of Python programming language and can write code to solve simple problems
- Arduino: I have beginner-level skills in using microcontrollers such as Arduino. I am familiar with the basics of Arduino programming, including setting up the development environment, writing and uploading code, and working with digital and analog inputs and outputs.
- Circuit Design: I have a basic understanding of circuit design principles and can create simple circuits using components commonly used with microcontrollers, such as resistors, capasitors, LEDs, and sensors.
- English Language: I have intermediate proficiency in speaking and writing in English, allowing me to effectively communicate and understand technical concepts.
  
## Projects
I'm happy to create these projects, I hope you will also enjoy using them.
- Coming soon.
